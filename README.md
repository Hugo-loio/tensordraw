Tensordraw is a Python package for easily creating tensor network diagrams.

Development of the project is ongoing, but it currently features:

* **Flexible geometries:** Tensors as circles or any polygon (rounded corners and holes available) with legs (indices) in any direction.
* **Easy contractions:** Automated and tunable curves for tensor contractions.
* **Highly customizable:** Ajust stroke and filling styles for all objects.
* **Vector output:** Produces fully editable vector outputs (SVG, PDF, PS or EPS) for post-production in tools like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

To be added:

1. Latex integration
2. More advanced filling and stroking styles
3. Documentation

# User guide

To install the developement version (for the moment the only version) run `./install.sh` and uninstall with `./unistall.sh`.

Example scripts for using the package can be found in the `examples` directory.
